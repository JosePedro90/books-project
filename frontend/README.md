## ðŸŽ¨ Design Choices

### Architecture

- **Component-Based Structure**: Reusable, modular components for maintainability and scalability.
- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety to reduce runtime errors and improve code quality.
- **Axios**: For handling HTTP requests to the backend API.
- **Chakra UI**: For accessible and customizable UI components.
- **TanStack Query**: For efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization.
- **Vite**: Fast and optimized build tool for modern frontend development.

### Key Implementation Details

1. **API Integration**

   - Uses Axios for communication with the Django backend.
   - Handles CRUD operations for book data.

2. **State Management**

   - Leverages **TanStack Query** for managing server state, caching, and background updates.

3. **Routing**

   - Implements `react-router-dom` for client-side routing between pages.

4. **Responsive Design**
   - Leveraged Chakra UIâ€™s responsive props for consistent design across devices.

## ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- npm 8+ or yarn

## ðŸš€ Local Development Setup

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JosePedro90/books-project.git
